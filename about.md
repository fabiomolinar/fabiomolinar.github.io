I am a father, a husband, and an **Automation & Control Engineer** professional who is passionate about technology, control theory and web technologies.

On my time out of the office I am a web developer and programmer. I am fascinated with the power of web technologies to bring people, resources and machines together. At this field I am also able to play with different stacks, both at the front and back end development.
